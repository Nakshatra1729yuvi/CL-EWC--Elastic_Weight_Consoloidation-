# 🧠 CL-EWC: Elastic Weight Consolidation

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Continual Learning with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** repository! 🎉

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**, a powerful technique designed to address the challenge of **catastrophic forgetting** in neural networks during continual learning scenarios.

In traditional machine learning, when a neural network is trained on a new task, it often "forgets" what it learned from previous tasks. EWC solves this problem by selectively protecting important weights from significant changes, allowing the model to learn new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned tasks.

## 🌟 Features

- 📊 **Visual Results**: Compare model performance with and without EWC
- 🎯 **Sequential Task Learning**: Train neural networks on multiple tasks sequentially
- 🛡️ **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**: Protect important weights while learning new tasks
- 📈 **Performance Metrics**: Track and visualize learning progress across tasks

## 🔍 What is Elastic Weight Consolidation?

Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) is a regularization technique that enables neural networks to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. The key innovation of EWC is:

1. **Fisher Information Matrix**: After learning a task, EWC computes the Fisher Information Matrix to identify which weights were most important for that task.

2. **Selective Weight Protection**: When learning a new task, EWC adds a penalty term to the loss function that prevents significant changes to important weights from previous tasks.

3. **Elastic Consolidation**: The technique acts like an "elastic band" - it allows some movement in weight space (to learn new tasks) while pulling back on weights that are crucial for old tasks.

### Mathematical Formulation

The EWC loss function is defined as:

```
L(θ) = L_B(θ) + (λ/2) Σᵢ Fᵢ(θᵢ - θ*ᵢ)²
```

Where:
- `L_B(θ)` is the loss for the current task
- `λ` is the importance weight of the old task
- `Fᵢ` is the Fisher information for parameter i
- `θ*ᵢ` is the optimal parameter value from the previous task

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Required Libraries

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter
pip install scikit-learn
```

Or install all at once:

```bash
pip install numpy torch torchvision matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nakshatra1729yuvi/CL-EWC--Elastic_Weight_Consoloidation-.git
cd CL-EWC--Elastic_Weight_Consoloidation-
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the EWC Notebook**:
   - Navigate to the repository folder in your browser
   - Click on the `.ipynb` file to open it

3. **Run the Cells**:
   - Execute each cell sequentially by pressing `Shift + Enter`
   - Follow the inline comments and markdown explanations

4. **Experiment**:
   - Modify hyperparameters (learning rate, λ value, number of epochs)
   - Try different network architectures
   - Test on different datasets

### Key Parameters to Adjust

- **λ (lambda)**: Controls the importance of old task knowledge (typical values: 0-10000)
  - Higher values = stronger protection of old weights
  - Lower values = more flexibility for new tasks

- **Learning Rate**: Affects how quickly the model adapts to new tasks

- **Number of Epochs**: Training duration for each task

## 📚 Understanding the Code

The notebook typically includes:

1. **Data Loading**: Preparing datasets for sequential tasks
2. **Model Definition**: Neural network architecture
3. **Fisher Information Calculation**: Computing importance weights after each task
4. **EWC Training Loop**: Training with the EWC regularization term
5. **Evaluation**: Testing performance on all learned tasks
6. **Visualization**: Plotting results and comparisons

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Robotics**: Learning new skills without forgetting basic motor functions
- **Natural Language Processing**: Adding new language capabilities while maintaining existing ones
- **Computer Vision**: Learning to recognize new objects while remembering old ones
- **Personalized AI**: Adapting models to individual users over time
- **Edge Devices**: Continuous learning on resource-constrained devices

## 📊 Expected Results

When running the notebook, you should observe:

- ✅ **With EWC**: Model maintains performance on Task A while learning Task B
- ❌ **Without EWC**: Model forgets Task A when learning Task B (catastrophic forgetting)
