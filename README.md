# 🧠 CL-EWC: Elastic Weight Consolidation

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Continual Learning with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** repository! 🎉

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**, a powerful technique designed to address the challenge of **catastrophic forgetting** in neural networks during continual learning scenarios.

In traditional machine learning, when a neural network is trained on a new task, it often "forgets" what it learned from previous tasks. EWC solves this problem by selectively protecting important weights from significant changes, allowing the model to learn new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned tasks.

## 🌟 Features

## 🔍 What is Elastic Weight Consolidation?

Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) is a regularization technique that enables neural networks to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. The key innovation of EWC is:

1. **Fisher Information Matrix**: After learning a task, EWC computes the Fisher Information Matrix to identify which weights were most important for that task.

2. **Selective Weight Protection**: When learning a new task, EWC adds a penalty term to the loss function that prevents significant changes to important weights from previous tasks.

3. **Elastic Consolidation**: The technique acts like an "elastic band" - it allows some movement in weight space (to learn new tasks) while pulling back on weights that are crucial for old tasks.

### Mathematical Formulation

The EWC loss function is defined as:

```
L(θ) = L_B(θ) + (λ/2) Σᵢ Fᵢ(θᵢ - θ*ᵢ)²
```

Where:
- `L_B(θ)` is the loss for the current task
- `λ` is the importance weight of the old task
- `Fᵢ` is the Fisher information for parameter i
- `θ*ᵢ` is the optimal parameter value from the previous task

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Required Libraries

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter
```

Or install all at once:

```bash
pip install numpy torch torchvision matplotlib jupyter
```

## 📝 Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nakshatra1729yuvi/CL-EWC--Elastic_Weight_Consoloidation-.git
cd CL-EWC--Elastic_Weight_Consoloidation-
```

### 2. Open the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook Elastic_Weight_Consolidation.ipynb
```

### 3. Run the Cells

Execute the notebook cells sequentially to:
- Load and preprocess datasets (FashionMNIST and MNIST)
- Define the neural network architecture
- Train the model on Task A (FashionMNIST)
- Calculate Fisher Information Matrix
- Train on Task B (MNIST) with and without EWC
- Visualize and compare results

## 🧩 Understanding the Code

### Key Components

1. **Network Architecture**
   ```python
   class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):
       # A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron
   ```

2. **Fisher Information Calculation**
   ```python
   def compute_fisher_information(model, data_loader, criterion):
       # Calculates importance of each weight
   ```

3. **EWC Loss Function**
   ```python
   def ewc_loss(model, fisher_dict, optimal_params, lambda_ewc):
       # Adds penalty for changing important weights
   ```

4. **Training with EWC**
   ```python
   def train_with_ewc(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, 
                     fisher_dict, optimal_params, lambda_ewc):
       # Training loop with EWC regularization
   ```

## 🎯 Use Cases

This implementation is perfect for:

- 🎓 **Educational purposes**: Learn how EWC works in practice
- 🔬 **Research projects**: Use as a baseline for continual learning experiments
- 🏗️ **Building blocks**: Integrate EWC into your own projects
- 📚 **Understanding theory**: See mathematical concepts in action

## 🌈 Expected Results

When you run the notebook, you should observe:

1. **Task A Performance**: The model learns FashionMNIST effectively
2. **Without EWC**: Performance on Task A degrades significantly after learning Task B
3. **With EWC**: Performance on Task A is better preserved while still learning Task B
4. **Visualizations**: Clear graphs showing the difference in catastrophic forgetting
